# Donation Experiment Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of the Karlan and List (2007) field experiment, which investigates the effectiveness of different fundraising treatments on donation behavior.

## Overview
The analysis focuses on exploring how different ask strategies, match ratios, and other socio-economic and demographic characteristics influence the probability and amount of donations.

## Data
- Source: `karlan_list_2007.dta`
- Dataset includes variables such as `treatment`, `donation amount`, `household income`, `education level`, `gender`, and other relevant features.

## Files
- `index.qmd`: Quarto markdown document containing code and narrative.
- `karlanlist.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook, outlining the code.

## Key Insights
- **Treatment Effects**: Treatment increased the donation rate slightly (2.2% vs 1.8%).
- **Donation Amounts**: Despite a higher response rate, the average donation in the treatment group was slightly lower than in the control group.
- **Simulations**:
  - Law of Large Numbers: Bernoulli Simulation confirms convergence of sample means to the true treatment effect as sample size increases.
  - Central Limit Theorem: Shows how the distribution of sample means approaches normality with larger sample sizes.

## Requirements
- Python (with packages such as pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, statsmodels)
- Quarto for rendering `.qmd` files

## How to Reproduce
1. Open `index.qmd` in Quarto.
2. Ensure the dataset (`karlan_list_2007.dta`) is in the working directory.
3. Render the Quarto file or run cells to reproduce plots and analysis.
